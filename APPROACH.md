# Xmas 2025 Card - A Holly & Ivy Killing - approach

This document outlines the approach taken to create this year's Christmas card.

## High-level approach

This year I wanted to make a card leveraging as much generative AI as possible, to see how far I could get with minimal _actual coding_. I wanted to see how far one could get with a completely _Vibe-coded_ solution.

### Concept development

I started by brainstorming ideas for the card's theme and story. I worked with Google Gemini 2.5 pro to form a plan on how we could create a Christmas themed murder mystery game.

I spent quite a while experimenting with creating a comprehensive prompt to get Gemini to plan out its approach and to work with me interactively. I was pretty pleased that there wasn't actually too much back and forth and we narrowed down the concept fairly quickly.

Once we had the story and character biographies for everyone nailed down, I instructed Gemini to create a detailed system prompt to represent each of the characters as AIs. Each character has its own instruction set and, therefore, only understands its specific context and role within the story. I wanted to work with a much faster model than Gemini 2.5 Pro, so asked for prompts that would work with Gemini 2.5 Flash.

At this point we had a set of system prompts that represented each distinct character.

### Code generation

I was pretty happy with what we had so far and I tested some of the system prompts directly with Gemini 2.5 Flash. I was impressed with how quickly it could generate responses based on the prompts I provided and the model didn't appear to get confused even as the context grew.

Next, I worked on the visual concept with Gemini. All of my work was done in a single (massive) conversation. I was impressed by how well Gemini could work with this much context and I found that it could recall details from much earlier in the conversation without issue.

I prompted it to create the key interfaces in plain HTML and CSS so that I could check the visual design. I was impressed with the first pass and didn't iterate further other than a few tweaks to bring consistency between the interfaces.

#### Imagery

Since I started working on the visual concept, Google released Nano Banana for image generation. This seemed like a great opportunity to try it out, so I prompted it to create character portraits for each of the characters based on the descriptions we had already created -- I was not disappointed. The images were fantastic and really brought the characters to life and I stuck to the initially generated images without any further adjustments.

#### Application logic

I took the HTML/CSS generated by Gemini and created a Qwik application to host the game. I pasted the static HTML into Qwik components and set up routing for the different views. At this point, I switched to using GitHub Copilot work in Visual Studio Code. I tried a mixture of Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT 4 (later 4.1 when it was released).

As mentioned before I wanted to code as little as possible, but rather rely on prompting to get to where I wanted. I used Agent mode in Copilot get it to adapt the static HTML into interactive components. I found that Copilot worked really well when I provided clear instructions on what I wanted to achieve. I was able to get it to create state management, event handlers, and navigation between views with minimal back and forth.

For some bits where it was quicker for me to make changes myself, I relied on Copilot's inline suggestions to speed up the coding process, but I did try to minimize this. I would say that the application is probably 80-90% generated by AI with only minor tweaks and adjustments made by me.

## Summary

I was very impressed with this approach as an approach to building a product concept. I think this is probably the most ambitious Christmas card I've coded and I've spent way less time overall on it than previous cards. Therefore, I would conclude that I can do more with less.

I was pleased with the quality of the code (although I did keep quite a close eye on it). At points I was a bit unhappy but figured if it worked, there was little point in improving it further. Qwik is hardly that mainstream yet compared to React or Vue, so I was pleased that the AI models could work with it so well and didn't pollute the code with React concepts. CloudFlare workers are also not that wide-spread, especially their integration with Qwik, but again, I was pleased that the AI models could work with it without issue.
